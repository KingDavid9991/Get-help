Welcome to Get-Help, a crowdfunding project built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity, Vite, and ThirdWeb.

My platform allows individuals and organizations to create campaigns and receive funding from supporters around the world. All transactions and pledges are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and security for both campaign creators and donors.

To use my platform, you will need a web3-enabled browser and a wallet with Ethereum (ETH) to make pledges. Once you have that, you can easily browse and support campaigns on my platform. As a campaign creator, you can create, manage and track your campaign's progress on the platform.

I have built Get-Help using Vite, a fast and light-weight development tool, and ThirdWeb, a framework that allows for easy integration of web3 functionality. This makes my platform efficient and user-friendly.

I believe that blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we fund and support causes, and I'm excited to be at the forefront of this movement with Get-Help.

Thank you for your support and I hope you enjoy using my platform!
